# fractal
Python program that will create a fractal image of a binary tree.

This program is being written for <a href = "http://www.udacity.com/course/ud036">Udacity's Programming Foundations in Python course</a>.

To explore creating your own visual images using the Turtle library, <a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html">read through the Turtle documentation</a>.


<h4>Current Status (2/8/2015):</h4>
- Currently, the tree prints offset to the left.
- Need to break out the "turtle walking back down the tree" portion into its own function, to simplify the algorithm of tree creation.
~~- Also, `total_nodes` should be set to 2 to the power of `max_depth`, rather than 3 (fixed, based on the test case of a tree of `max_depth` 3).~~ DONE.
